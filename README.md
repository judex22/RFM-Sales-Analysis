# RFM-Sales-Analysis
The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict
how a new customer is likely to act in the future. 

The customer categories generated using RFM Segmentation Model are of types: 'Lost Customers','Slipping Away','New Customers','Potential Churners',
'Best Customers', and 'Active Customers'. 

These Labels generated using this customer segmentation technique is useful for businesses to know which customers to focus on inorderto increase sales and
retain customers.

An RFM model is built using three key factors:

              a)how Recently a customer has transacted with a brand
              b)how Frequently they’ve engaged with a brand
              c)how much Money (Monetary Value) they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services
